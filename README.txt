Music database based on Turbogears (Python web framework) and Mutagen (to deal
with mp3 tags). The database could be stored in TG supported db engines
(sqlite, postgres, mysql etc.). The engine provides web interface to store and
rate your album collection, and to visualize statistical information (number of
average rating of albums by genres, countries etc.), also you can trace or get
statistics about time when you rate album.
